"3‚Äì4 KM": 24,000 TZS

"6‚Äì10 KM": 28,000 TZS
"10‚Äì15 KM": 38,000 TZS
"NJE YA MAENEO HAYA": 44,000 TZS
```

**If student uses BOTH morning and evening:**

```

#### ‚úÖ Monthly Multipliers (Applied Automatically)

```javascript
January: 1.5√ó (e.g., 34,000 √ó 1.5 = 51,000 TZS)
February: 1√ó
March: 1√ó
April: 0.8√ó (e.g., 34,000 √ó 0.8 = 27,200 TZS)
May: 1√ó
June: 0√ó (NO PAYMENT - holidays)
July: 1.5√ó
August: 1√ó
September: 0.8√ó
October: 1√ó
November: 1.25√ó (e.g., 34,000 √ó 1.25 = 42,500 TZS)
December: 0√ó (NO PAYMENT - holidays)
```

**Calculation Function:**
```javascript
function expectedForMonth(amStop, pmStop, monthIndex) {
  const amPrice = amStop ? priceForStop(amStop) : 0;
  const pmPrice = pmStop ? priceForStop(pmStop) : 0;
  const base = amPrice + pmPrice;
  const multiplier = MONTH_MULTIPLIERS[monthIndex] ?? 1;
  return Math.round(base * multiplier);
}
