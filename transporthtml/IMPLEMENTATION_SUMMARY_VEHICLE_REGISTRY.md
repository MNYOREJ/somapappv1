## Developer: AI Assistant in collaboration with SoMAp Team

---

## ✅ COMPLETED FEATURES

### 1. **Payment Synchronization** ✓
**Location:** `transport.html` and `transportpayments.html`

- **Fixed:** Payment data now synchronizes correctly between both pages
- **Implementation:** 
  - Added `state.transportPayments` to load from `transport_payments` database
  - Updated `renderKpis()` function to calculate "Paid This Month" from actual payment records
  - Now shows real-time payment data in KPI cards
  - Formula: Filters payments by `month` and `year`, then sums amounts

**Result:** The "Paid This Month" KPI now accurately reflects payments recorded in the system.

---

### 2. **Driver Integration from Workers Database** ✓
**Location:** `transportbuses.html`

- **Connected:** Workers admission system to transport system
- **Implementation:**
  - Loads all workers with `role: 'driver'` from `workers` database
  - Populates dropdown in vehicle registration form
  - Shows driver full name and phone number
  - Only shows active drivers (`active !== false`)

**Database Path:** `workers/{workerId}/profile/role === 'driver'`

**Result:** Drivers registered through `workersadmission.html` automatically appear in the vehicle assignment dropdown.

---

### 3. **Route Dropdown with All Available Routes** ✓
**Location:** `transportbuses.html`

- **Added:** Complete route dropdown with all 73+ routes from the transport system
- **Features:**
  - Organized by distance categories (1 KM, 1.5 KM, 2 KM, etc.)
  - Shows route name and distance classification
  - Example: "Jirani na Shule (1 KM)", "Kisongo (10-15 KM)"

**Result:** Easy route selection with clear distance and pricing information.

---

### 4. **Multiple Routes Per Vehicle** ✓
**Location:** `transportbuses.html`

- **Capability:** Vehicles can now be assigned to multiple routes
- **Features:**
  - "+ Add Route" button to add additional route cards
  - "Remove" button on each route card
  - Dynamic form fields
  - Stores as array: `assignedRoutes: ['route1', 'route2', ...]`

**Result:** One vehicle can serve multiple routes (e.g., morning and evening routes).

---

### 5. **Payment Agreement & Contract Management** ✓
**Location:** `transportbuses.html`

- **Fields Added:**
  - Ownership Type: School Owned vs Contracted
  - Payment Frequency: Weekly / Monthly / Yearly

  - Contract Notes

- **Smart Form:** Contract fields only appear when "Contracted" is selected
- **Validation:** Required fields enforce complete contract information

**Database Structure:**
```javascript
{
  ownershipType: 'contracted',
  paymentFrequency: 'monthly',
  paymentAmount: 500000,
  contractNotes: 'Payment due on 1st of each month'
}
```

**Result:** Clear tracking of vehicle contracts and payment obligations.

---

### 7. **Auto-Populate Vehicle & Driver in Student Assignment** ✓

  4. Shows warning if no vehicle assigned to route

- **Visual Design:**
  - Green-bordered cards for assigned vehicles
  - Red-bordered alerts for unassigned routes
