# üöê Vehicle Registry - Testing & Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue Fixed: "+ Add Vehicle" Button Disappearing

### **What Was Wrong:**
The "+ Add Vehicle" button was flashing and disappearing on page load because:
1. The button visibility was controlled by permission checks
2. Permission checks happened asynchronously after page load
3. Button would show briefly, then hide before role was properly loaded

### **What Was Fixed:**
1. ‚úÖ Added proper loading state while authentication initializes
2. ‚úÖ Improved permission check logic to wait for role to load
3. ‚úÖ Added console logging to debug role issues
4. ‚úÖ Added better error handling for driver loading failures
5. ‚úÖ Made button visibility more predictable

## üîç **DEBUGGING TIPS**

### Check Your Role in Firebase:
```
Database path: users/{your-user-id}/role
Should be: "admin" or "transport_officer" or similar
```

### Check Drivers in Firebase:
```
Database path: workers/{worker-id}/profile/role
Driver's role should be: "driver"
Driver's active should be: true (or not set)
```

### Check Saved Vehicles:
```
Database path: transport/SoMAp/2025/buses/{bus-id}
Should contain: plate, makeModel, capacity, assignedDriverUid, assignedRoutes, etc.
```

### Browser Console Commands:
Open browser console (F12) and type:
```javascript
// Check current state
console.log('Role:', state.role);
console.log('User:', state.user);
console.log('Drivers loaded:', state.drivers.length);
console.log('Vehicles loaded:', state.vehicles.length);

// Check if you can edit
console.log('Can edit:', canEdit());
```
